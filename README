Usage

vim-www just opens urls in your web browser. But vim-www understands three types of url references:

    A typical URI, e.g. http://vim.org .
    A defined plain tag. E.g., tag "vimcom" can be configured to reference http://www.vim.org/community.php .
    A defined search engine tag. E.g., tag "g?" can be configured to search in google a query that can be provided.

Tags can be configured creating the dictionary g:www_urls in your .vimrc. E.g.:

let g:www_urls = {
         \ 'vimcom' : 'http://www.vim.org/community.php',
         \ 'g?' : 'https://www.google.com/search?q=',
         \
         \ }

Notice that search engine tags end with a ? character and that the search query will be appended to the defined url.

To open those urls you use the command :Wopen, which accepts a url reference as argument. E.g.:

:Wopen http://vim.org
:Wopen vimcom
:Wopen g?vim scripts

Above commands will open http://vim.org, http://www.vim.org/community.php urls and the resulting url of searching the string "vim scripts" in google, respectively.

If you preffer you can use :Wopenmulti command to open multiple urls in one step. But, please, notice that, as it is a multiple arguments command, you must scape blankspaces in the string you provide to search engines. E.g:

:Wopenmulti http://vim.org vim g?vim\ scripts

Default search engine

You can also configure google or any other as your default search engine, through:

let g:www_default_search_engine = 'g?'

and then you can just do:

:Wsearch vim scripts

By default, google will be used.
Sessions

Urls can also be grouped in sessions in the following way:

let g:www_sessions = {
         \ 'vim' : ['http://vim.org', 'vimcom', 'g?vim scripts'],
         \
         \ }

Then you can open in one step all referenced urls with:

:Wsession vim

Mappings

There are also some convenient mappings:

    <leader>wo . In normal mode it will open the browser using the WORD under the cursor as url reference. In visual mode it will do the same with your text selection.

    <leader>ws . In normal mode it will search the WORD under the cursor in your default search engine. In visual mode it will do the same with your text selection.

Defaults

Some search engines are already provided by default by vim-www. Here it is the current relation:
Tag 	Website
g? 	https://google.com
y? 	http://youtube.com
gh? 	https://github.com
bb? 	https://bitbucket.org
so? 	http://stackoverflow.com
wiki? 	http://en.wikipedia.org
imdb? 	http://www.imdb.com

Google (g?) is the default search engine.

You can overwrite these defaults and define new ones with g:www_urls.
